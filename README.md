## Description
<p>Not nearly as advanced as Pong. This oval ball moves back and forth diagonally as an assignment to begin learning about JavaScript animation.</P>

## Usage
<p>This was a first step into movement in JavaScript through the MIT Bootcamp program, meant for getting a grasp on the concepts.</P>

## Roadmap
<p>Over the coming months, I hope (plan) to understand this better and improve the animation while adding more moving objects.</P>
